  "content": "**Please read and agree to these server rules before using our Discord services. **Violation of these rules may result in moderation action being taken against you. \n\nThese are only the rules for our Discord server; to find the entire list, look at the bottom of this message.\n\nNote that starting August 28th 2022, under *YG Moderation act 2022-08-28*, members are required to follow and moderators are required to enforce these rules. \n\nThe level of enforcement is decided based on an evaluation by the moderators there at the time, at their discretion. However, not enforcing rules can lead to a violation of the above act. If you believe action taken against you was unfair, please talk to another moderator or file a claim in the Yourt.\n\nThe Yourt has the final say on all action and, if requested, all action will be reviewed. Note that if someone is violating the rules, you can report it at the Yourt as well.\n\n━━\n\n**CORRECTION**\nThe action will be corrected.\n\n**REMINDER**\nNo punishment will occur; a reminder will be issued.\n\n**WARNING**\nThere are 5 levels of `Warning`. After reaching the 5th level, it is up to the moderators to decide if a `Kick/Ban` should be issued. You will be given the `Prisoner` role once you hit 5, either for a set amount of time/until the moderators reach a consensus. \n\n**TIME-OUT**\nAn official Discord feature which stops the user from talking and reacting for a set amount of time. Usually, this will only be used for very light cases for a few minutes in order to help stop the problem.\n\n**PRISONER**\nThis role stops removes all your permissions in the server and puts you at the bottom of the hierarchy. You will not be able to do anything until this role has been removed. Placement of this role can either be as a punishment, or for when your actions are still being reviewed. You can always access the Yourt.\n\n**KICK/BAN**\nAt moderators' discretion. You will either be kicked or banned from our server.\n\n━━\n\n**Updated for: `30th August, 2022` — `2.0`**",
