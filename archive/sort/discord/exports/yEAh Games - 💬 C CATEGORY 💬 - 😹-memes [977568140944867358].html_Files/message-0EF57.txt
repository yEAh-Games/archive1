Actually 😳, the Soviet 🇨🇳🛠 Union 🛠✊ ended 🏁 at 11:40 PM 😼👌💥, not 11:40 AM. Lol 😂. I 🚟👁 saw 👁 that you 👈 didn't reply 🔁 for an hour 🕐 and I 👁 think 🤔 I 👁 know 🤔 why 🤔. Lol 😂🖕. It's because you 👈 saw 👀 me, a HISTORY 📂📜📚 buff 💪, put 😏 a comment 🗣 to correct ✔✅ you 👈. To save 💾 you 👉 all 💯 the boring 😂😴🚫 details 🙌🏽, you 👉 can already 👋 tell 🗣 I 👁 am a history 🚫 buff 💪 by the subscriptions 💯 I 👁 have on 🔛 my Youtube 📺 account 😠: "Comrade 🇷🇺 Stalin 👨". Lol 😂. You 👉 will see 👀 that I 🕵👁 am subscribed 💯 to various 🤓🧐 HISTORICAL 🚫 Youtube 📺 channels 📺👀, two ✌ of my favourites 😍 being 'Simple 😡 History' 📂📜📚 and 'Oversimplified' I 👁 like 👍🏻 these accounts 💳 for how engaging they are, particularly 😇 through the usage 🏻 of dank 👌 memes 🐸. I 👁 really 💯 like 👍 these dank 👌 memes 🐸👽 because it shows 📺 HISTORICAL 📂📜📚 events 🎉 in a humorous 😝🤣 way ↕, such as, The Second ⏱ World 🌎 War 💦🔫 (probably 😻 the topic 💰 I 👁 know 🤔👀 the most about). I 👁 think 💭 you 👈 are starting 🆕⚠ to see 😩👀🚫 where I 👥 am going 🏃, lol...my favourite 😍👮 dank 👌 memes 🐸 are countryballs (or polandball lol 🤣), I 👁 enjoy 💯 watching 👀 countryball videos 📹 on 🔛 Youtube 📹 then looking 👀 at the comments 💬🗯 to correct ✅ any historical 📜 inaccuracies, because I'm 💘 a history 🚫 buff 💪 they all 💯 realise 😂 that I 👥 know 💭 what I'm 😼👌💥 talking 🗣❗❌ about because I'm 💘 a history 📂📜📚 buff 💪.

Something 😅 else 😩 which definitely 💯 shows 📺 my HISTORICAL 🚫 finesse 🤑😎 is my music 🎧 taste 😋, I 👁 listen 👂 to classical 🎻 music 🎶🎵🎧 such as Bach 🎻🎼🎹 and Mozart 😂 10 🔳 hour 😞😳 compilation(s 🎯). But 🍑, my favourite 👅😍 composer ⚙🔌 is Tchaikovsky (not sure 👍 if you've heard 👂 of him 👴). He's 👥 from this country 🇺🇸🏞🌎 called 📞 Russia 🇷🇺 (not sure 💯 if you've heard 👂👀🙉 of it). I 👁 think 🤔 Russia 🇷🇺 is a very ✅ pleasant 🙏 country 🇺🇸 (probably 😻 the most pleasant 🙏 in the world 🌎) and by far 🌌 the best 🏆 military 🔫💣 wise 🎓 (which is basically 😎 all 💯 that matters 🙅, because it can beat 🚮👊🏻 ANY country 🏞 in a war ⚔🔫.) But 🍑, personally 👫, I 👁 think 💭 Russia's 🇷🇺 golden 🏅💛 age 📆 ended 🔚 in 1991 when ⏰ Communism 🇷🇺 ended 🔚 there. I 👥 can name 📛 EVERY ☝ SINGLE ☝ piece 🧩 of Soviet 😮 (WW2 🔫) weapon 🔫 (like 💖 tanks 🚔😳 and guns 🔫), and every 💯 Soviet 🔴 leader 🔆 in order 📲📱 since 👨 I'm 💘 a history 📜 buff 💪! I'm 💘 currently 💰 learning 💭🎓📗 Russian 🇷🇺 and I 👁 can't ❌ wait 🚏⏰🗾 to finally 👆 go 🏃. I 👁 plan 📝 to live 🐙 there one 😤 day 🙏🌞.

I 👥 know 🤔 what you're thinking 🤔, how can I 👁 possibly 🤔 have such an extraordinary 😅😹 and intellectual 🎩 mind 🧠🙉🤦 such as this? Haha 😂, I 👁 know 💭, but 🍑 the answer ✅ is simple 😡: I 👁 am a history 📂📜📚 buff 💪.

The other thing 📴 I'm 💘 really 💯 into (other than WW2 💂🎖) is Celtic ☘ Mythology 🐲 and Paganism 🧚‍♂️. (I'm 💘 not Celtic ☘ in any way 💫 shape 🤙👀 or form 📋) but 🍑 I 👁 really 💯 think 🤔 all 💯 Celtic ☘ areas ⚠💀 should form 🐛 one ☝ country 🏞 and fight 👊👿 the West 🌎 (even 🌃 though 🤔 I'm 💘 from the West 🌎) because they run 🏃🏿‍♀️🙀😰 a cruel 😈 capitalist 💰 regime 😖. You 👉🙋 probably 😻 realise ⚠💡 now that I 👁 seriously 😶😐 know 💭 my stuff 💰 and it's not even 🌃 worth 💰 replying ↩ to this comment 💬🗯 because I'm 💘 a history 📜 buff 💪.

I 👁 am also 👨 an avid 4chan 🍀 and Reddit 💻📱👽 user 🏻, I 👁 follow 🔜 r/communism and r/marxism and r/vexillology (I 👁 enjoy 💯👌 going 🏃 into paint 🎨 and changing 🚼 a country's 🇺🇸 flag 🚩🎢 into a communist 👻 version 📼 you 👉 probably 🤔 can't ❌❗ imagine 💭 what that utopia 🇺🇸 would be like 💖 LOL 😂). You're probably 😻 looking 👀 at my YT right ✔ now to see 👀 if I 👁 am a history 📂📜📚 buff 💪, but 🍑💦 I 👁 am because I 👁 make 💘 alt ⬅ history 📂📜📚 videos 📼 from the Soviet 🔁 perspective 👀, because I'm 💘 a history 🚫 buff 💪. Have a great 👍 day 📆, no 🚫 hard ✅💎 feelings 😜. :)

-Please 🙏 have mercy ✝🎃 on 🔛 us 💦👨👅, history 🚫 buffs 💪. We're not worthy 💰.
